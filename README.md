# Heart Disease Risk Prediction

### By Markus Chu

## Introduction
According to the World Health Organization, heart disease is still the leading cause of death globally, with over 17.9 million deaths per year, which is about 32% of all global fatalities (World Health Organization, 2021). Even with medical advancements like the use of AI, it is still hard to detect heart disease in its early stages. It is important to consider that traditional diagnostic methods rely on clinical assessments, tests, and imaging, which are time-consuming, expensive, and sometimes even inaccessible.

Using machine learning (ML) offers an approach to predict heart disease risk efficiently and cost-effectively. These predictive models can consider a variety of health factors to analyze patterns related to heart disease risk. This allows for earlier responses, such as potential lifestyle adjustments, medical treatment, or additional diagnostic testing.

## Objective

**The goal of this project is to develop an accurate ML model that predicts one's risk of getting heart disease with patient data.**

This model will:
1. Provide binary classification (presence or absence of heart disease)
2. Generate risk probabilities (0-100%)
3. Identify key contributing factors of heart disease

Intended use:
1. Help doctors make early decisions
2. Let patients check their own health risks
3. Support research on how health risk factors work together
